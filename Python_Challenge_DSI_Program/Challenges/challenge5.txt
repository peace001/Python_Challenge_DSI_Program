1) By a theoretical calculation or by writing and running some code, find the probability of throwing a ’1’ followed by a ’2’ followed by a ’3’ when rolling a 6-sided dice three times (give your answer to 3 decimal places, e.g. 24.521%)?

2)With reference to the dice problem in question above, is the probability of throwing three '1's in a row:
      ==> more likely
      ==> less likely
      ==> equally likely 
      
as compared to your answer in 1?
