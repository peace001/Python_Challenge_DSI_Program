#1 )  $ 103.68 B

#2) A company X growing exponentially for the last 10 years means 
R2017 =  R2016 * exp(alpha) , R2016 = R2015 * exp(alpha)   where alpha is a coefficient to determinate.
 
Moving 10 years back, the initial revenue was R2008 = R0 , This means we can rephrase R2018 to R10 and R2017 to R9.  Then, by a conjecture and in analogy with the exponential decay law, we have R (t+1)  = R0 * exp(alpha * t)

Applying the above equation to the revenues in 2016 and 2017, we get the value of alpha which is equal to  Ln (6/5). Where Ln is neperian logarithm. 
The knowledge of alpha enables us to calculate  R0 by doing:

R0 = 50 / (exp( alpha * 2016) =   $ 11.62 B

The revenue in 2020 which is R12 is therefore a straightforward calculation
