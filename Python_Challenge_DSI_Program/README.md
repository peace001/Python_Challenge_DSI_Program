# Basic Python codes
A place to share the codes I wrote when competing to secure a seat for the Data Science Intensive Program in CapeTown in South Africa.

You can find here mathy exercises that find solutions into writing simple codes.

No need to use any external packages, just built-in modules. 


Feel free to share!

Rockefeller!
